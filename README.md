#*Road map*

1.	First we installed python and its streamlit library from command promt
2.	Now we designed the logo of our website using paint software
3.	Then we started in building the user interface and imported respective api's  to fetch data.
4.	We used wikipedia api to fetch data from wikipedia to provide artist information.
5.	We used youtubes api to get the songs of the artist searched.
6.	Then we integrated both these functions into a single code and to be displayed in the same page
7.	Now we updated the above function to operate simultaneously without using searchbar twice.
8.	Finally we organised our code and made sure everything was functioning systematically.
